## `layout-ncol`

Use the `layout-ncol` chunk option to organize output in columns, e.g., `layout-ncol: 2` for two tables side-by-side.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: tbl-label
#| tbl-cap: Two tables
#| tbl-subcap: ["mtcars", "Just cars"]
#| layout-ncol: 2

library(knitr)

# table on the left
kable(head(mtcars[, 1:3]))

# table on the right
kable(head(cars))
```
