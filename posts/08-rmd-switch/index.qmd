## Switching over from R Markdown?

If you are an R Markdown user starting to use Quarto for your new projects or if you are converting an existing R Markdown project to Quarto, I highly recommend reading the [FAQ for R Markdown Users](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html).

You might particularly find the [I use X (bookdown, blogdown, etc.). What is the Quarto equivalent?](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html#i-use-x-bookdown-blogdown-etc..-what-is-the-quarto-equivalent)
question as it provides a table comparing R Markdown outputs with Quarto formats, providing a roadmap for where to get started depending on the nature of your project.

It should also be noted that R Markdown is not going away.
Quarto simply expands the scope of R Markdown, and R Markdown will continue to be actively supported.
