## `echo: fenced`

If you, like me, spend most of your time writing teaching materials or documentation, I'm sure you'll find the chunk option `echo: fenced` just as useful as I do!
When you set this option for a code chunk, the chunk is displayed with the fences around it -- without a screenshot or using a special verbatim engine.

To get code chunks printed out as

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: simple-arithmetic
#| results: hide

1 + 1
```

add the `echo: fenced` option to your chunk:

``` {{r}}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: simple-arithmetic
#| results: hide

1 + 1
```

Note that in the output all chunk options other than `echo: fenced` are shown, so this is a great tool for teaching chunk options as well.
