## **Font Awesome**

Including Font Awesome icons in Quarto documents is now easy peasy lemon squeezy {{< fa lemon >}} with the [Font Awesome extension](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome).
Just surround the Font Awesome icon name in `{{<` and `>}}`.

| input                       |         output          |
|-----------------------------|:-----------------------:|
| `{{{< fa brands apple >}}}` | {{< fa brands apple >}} |
| `{{{< fa calendar >}}}`     |   {{< fa calendar >}}   |
| `{{{< fa user-doctor >}}}`  | {{< fa user-doctor >}}  |
| `{{{< fa door-closed >}}}`  | {{< fa door-closed >}}  |

To use this extension run the following in your terminal in the Quarto project you want to use these icons.

``` bash
