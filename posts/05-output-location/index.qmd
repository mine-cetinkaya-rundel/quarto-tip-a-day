The code uses ggplot2 to create a scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species. On the right is output showing this plot."

## `output-location`

Showing code and output side-by-side or delayed reveal of the output are commonly used techniques for teaching programming when the mode of delivery is slides.
The `output-location` chunk option makes it easy to achieve these.

Possible values for the `output-location` option are as follows:

-   `fragment`: Display output as a [fragment](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments), i.e., delay showing it until it is explicitly stepped through by advancing the slides.
-   `slide`: Display output on the subsequent slide.
-   `column`: Display output in a column adjacent to the code. This splits the slide into two columns, each of which span 50% of the width of the slide
-   `column-fragment`: Display output in a column adjacent to the code and delay showing it until its explicitly stepped through by advancing the slides.

You can see these in action in the slide deck below.

```{=html}
<iframe width="800px" height="533px" style="border:2px solid #dee2e6;" src="output-location.html"></iframe>
```
Note that for the column options I also adjusted `fig-height` and `fig-width` since the default size and aspect ration doesn't work well for figures spanning only half the width of the slide.
