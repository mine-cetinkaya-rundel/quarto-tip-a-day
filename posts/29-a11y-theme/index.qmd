## `a11y`

Quarto comes with accessible (with respect to color contrast) theme for syntax highlighting: `a11y`.
This theme is adaptive, so it automatically switches between a dark and light mode based upon the theme of the website.
It is designed to work well with sites with dark / light mode.

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    highlight-style: a11y
    theme:
      light: flatly
      dark: darkly
```

Here is a website with a light and dark theme.
Click on the light/dark toggle on the top right corner of the page and observe the syntax highlighting adapt to the background color.
The two highlight styles shown are `a11y-dark` and `a11y-light`.

```{=html}
<iframe width="800px" height="533px" style="border:2px solid #dee2e6;" src="https://mine.quarto.pub/a11y/"></iframe>
```
::: callout-note
You might need to click on the hamburger menu on the top right to reveal the light/dark toggle if you're on a narrow screen or zoomed in.
:::

If you want to use this highlighting style but don't want it to be adaptive, you can set `highlight-style` to your preference.
For example, for this blog, [I have it set it to `a11y-dark`](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/quarto-tip-a-day/blob/10eafdffa2dabf83409e0ce22f854d682782d503/_quarto.yml#L45).
