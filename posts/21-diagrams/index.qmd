## Diagrams

Quarto supports creating diagrams (flow charts, sequence diagrams, etc.) in with [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).

To create a diagram with Mermaid, use a `mermaid` chunk.
For example, Figure @fig-mermaid depicts how Quarto orchestrates rendering of documents.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: fenced
%%| label: fig-mermaid
%%| fig-width: 6
%%| fig-cap: |
%%|   How Quarto orchestrates rendering of documents: start with 
%%|   a qmd file, use the Knitr or Jupyter engine to perform the 
%%|   computations and convert it to an md file, then use Pandoc 
%%|   to convert to various file formats including HTML, PDF, 
%%|   and Word.

  A[qmd] --> B(Knitr)
  A[qmd] --> C(Jupyter)
  B(Knitr) --> D[md]
  C(Jupyter) --> D[md]
  D[md] --> E(pandoc)
  E(pandoc) --> F(HTML)
  E(pandoc) --> G(PDF)
  E(pandoc) --> H(Word)
  E(pandoc) --> I{and more}
```

Note that diagrams can be treated as figures, with chunk options like `fig-width` and `fig-cap`.
And prefixing the `label` with `fig-` allows us to cross-reference it and for the diagram to get figure numbering.

And below is the Graphviz version of this diagram.
Note that it uses a different engine: `dot`.

```{dot}
//| echo: fenced
graph G {
  layout=neato
  qmd -- Knitr;
  qmd -- Jupyter;
  Knitr -- md;
  Jupyter -- md;
  md -- pandoc;
  pandoc -- HTML;
  pandoc -- PDF;
  pandoc -- Word;
  pandoc -- more;
}
```

Couple of notes on creating diagrams with Quarto:

-   For Mermaid diagrams, use `%%|` for chunk options. For Graphviz, use `//|`.
-   The online editors for Mermaid and Graphviz are very helpful for interactively developing the code for a diagram:
    -   [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)

    -   [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)
