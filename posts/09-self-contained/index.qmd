## `self-contained: true`

If you want to create an entirely self-contained HTML document (with images, CSS, etc. embedded into the HTML file), add the following to the YAML of your document.

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    self-contained: true
```

This produces a standalone HTML with no external dependencies.

-   This works with `.qmd` and `.ipynb` files.
-   If instead of publishing the document, you want to share it using a file sharing service (e.g., Dropbox) or email it to someone just like you share other document types like spreadsheets, presentations, and PDFs, you should use this option to generate a self-contained HTML.
-   Quarto presentations created with revealjs can also be published as self-contained HTML.
-   Math libraries are not embedded in self-contained HTML documents by default (because they are quite large and often time consuming to download) but you can add `self-contained-math: true` to your YAML to embed them as well.
