## `theme:` `light` / `dark`

Quarto websites support light and dark themes and will automatically add a light/dark toggle to your website if you supply both themes.

``` yaml
---
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: litera
      dark: darkly
---
```

You can also customize your light and dark themes and and supply custom theme files in addition to the [Bootswatch themes](https://bootswatch.com/) you're using.

``` yaml
---
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: [litera, styles.scss]
      dark: [darkly, styles-dark.scss]
---
```

Here are the custom styles I'm using on this website:

-   [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/quarto-tip-a-day/blob/main/styles.scss)
-   [`styles-dark.scss`](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/quarto-tip-a-day/blob/main/styles-dark.scss)

If you know you want to offer the light/dark toggle, and you are planning to use a Bootswatch theme, I recommend browsing the options thoroughly first can decide on a light and a dark theme that look similar except for the colors and using that pair.
