## `fig-alt`

You can add alternative text to figures you create with code by adding the `fig-alt` chunk option, which works for Knitr, Jupyter, and Observable code chunks.

Here is an R/Knitr example.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: penguins-plot
#| warning: false
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species.
#|   The relationship is positive for each of the three species.

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(colorblindr)

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_OkabeIto()
```

The resulting HTML is shown below. This alternative (`alt`) text is accessible to screen readers.

``` html
<img src="index_files/figure-html/penguins-plot-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species. The relationship is positive for each of the three species." width="672">
```
