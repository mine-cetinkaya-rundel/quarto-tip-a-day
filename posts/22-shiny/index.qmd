image-alt: "Code and output for a radioInput() widget that asks the question Are you a cat or dog person? with choices Cat person, Dog person, Don't make me choose, and Neither. An arrow points to code for defining output$radio_output that places the widget value in a renderPrint() function. Finally, code and output for rendering the widget value with verbatimTextOutput().

## Shiny

You can create interactive Quarto documents using Shiny.
To do so:

-   Add `server: shiny` to the YAML of your document.
-   Define Shiny UI elements in plain R code chunks.
-   Place Shiny server code in R code chunks with the chunk option `context: server`.

Below is an example of a Quarto document with Shiny elements in it.
Click on a different radio button to see the effect in the document.

```{=html}
<iframe width="800px" height="1000px" style="border:2px solid #dee2e6;" src="https://minecr.shinyapps.io/shiny-in-quarto/"></iframe>
```
You can also click on the `</> Code` link in the document to view the source code for the document.

You'll see that:

-   We create an input widget called `radio_input` in the first code chunk.
-   The value of this widget is stored in `output$radio_output` (which is in a code chunk with `context: server`, which is not visible in the rendered document).
-   The output element called `radio_output` is displayed using the `verbatimTextOutput` in the last code chunk.

This document is then deployed to `shinyapps.io`.
You can find the standalone document at [https://minecr.shinyapps.io/shiny-in-quarto](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/shiny-in-quarto/).

## Interactivity

In addition to [Shiny](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/), you can add interactivity to your Quarto documents with:

-   [Observable JS](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/)
-   [Jupyter Widgets](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/widgets/jupyter.html)
-   [htmlwidgets](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/widgets/htmlwidgets.html)
