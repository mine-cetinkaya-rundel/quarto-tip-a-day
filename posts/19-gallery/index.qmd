## Quarto Gallery

Need some Quarto inspiration?
Want to see examples of what others are creating with Quarto?
And importantly, *how* they're creating them?
Take a look at the newly refreshed [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/).

The Quarto Gallery contains examples of

-   [articles and reports](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#articles-reports),
-   [presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#presentations),
-   [interactive documents](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#interactive-documents),
-   [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites), and
-   [books](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#books).

Each example on the gallery links to its source code, which you can peruse for inspiration or to learn how others have achieved a particular look or functionality.

If you plan on reusing any of the content from the gallery, make sure to check out the license of the document/project first!

And if you have Quarto artifacts you'd like to share with others on the gallery, and the source code for that project is publicly available, let us know in a [discussion post](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/issues) on the Quarto documentation repo.
