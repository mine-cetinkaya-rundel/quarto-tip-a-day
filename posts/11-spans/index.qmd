## Spans

You can apply styles to inline text by creating spans using `[]` to surround the text you want to style and `{}` to define the style you want to apply.

For example, to achieve the styling in the following sentence:

> To draw attention to a specific part of the text, you might want to make it [red]{style="color: red;"} with a [yellow background]{style="background-color: yellow;"}; [like this]{style="color: red; background-color: yellow;"}.

You can use the following:

``` markdown
To draw attention to a specific part of the text, you might want to make it [red]{style="color: red;"} with a [yellow background]{style="background-color: yellow;"}; [like this]{style="color: red; background-color: yellow;"}.
```

Some tips for using spans:

-   If you're authoring in RStudio using the visual editor, you can create a span by selecting the text you want to format and using the **Format -\> Span** command.

-   You can also define a CSS class and apply it to the span. For example,

``` css
.important {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}
```

-   Spans can also be used to define [fragments](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments) in Quarto revealjs presentations.
