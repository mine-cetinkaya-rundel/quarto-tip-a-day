## `slide-tone`

You can set your Quarto presentation to play a subtle sound when slide is advanced to the next slide or as part of incremental build in a given slide.
This enables presenters to hear an auditory signal (from a low C to a high C note) of their progress through the slides.

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    slide-tone: true
```

This feature can be particularly useful for blind users who use a screen reader or otherwise interact with content via auditory signals.
You can see it in action in the slide deck below.
Make sure to turn your audio on.
