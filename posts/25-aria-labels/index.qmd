## `icon`s and `aria-label`s

For Quarto websites, you can add `icon`s as [Nav Items](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#nav-items) in the [navbar](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#navbar) and/or [page footer](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#footer) YAML. The value of the `icon` field can be the name of any of the [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). To make these items accessible to screen readers, you should also add an `aria-label` describing what the navigation item is.

For example, here are snippets from the YAML for the [Quarto documentation website](https://quarto.org/). 

From the top navbar:

```yaml
website:
  navbar:
    right:
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/quarto_pub
        aria-label: Quarto Twitter
```

From the page footer:

```yaml
website:
  page-footer:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli
        aria-label: Quarto GitHub
```
