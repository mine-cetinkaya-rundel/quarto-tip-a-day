# quarto-tip-a-day

Inspired by the saying "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", this project titled "A Quarto tip a day keeps the docs away" is a playful attempt to share Quarto tips for a month leading up to the rstudio::conf(2022) keynote on Quarto by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Julia Stewart Lowndes.
