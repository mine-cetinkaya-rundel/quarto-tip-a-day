The resulting figure as well as the HTML which shows the alt text for the image.\"\n---\n\n\n## `fig-alt`\n\nYou can add alternative text to figures you create with code by adding the `fig-alt` chunk option, which works for Knitr, Jupyter, and Observable code chunks.\n\nHere is an R/Knitr example.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| label: penguins-plot\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-alt: |\n#|   Scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species.\n#|   The relationship is positive for each of the three species.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(colorblindr)\n\nggplot(penguins, \n       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_OkabeIto()\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/penguins-plot-1.png){fig-alt='Scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species.\nThe relationship is positive for each of the three species.' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting HTML is shown below. This alternative (`alt`) text is accessible to screen readers.\n\n``` html\n<img src=\"index_files/figure-html/penguins-plot-1.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species. The relationship is positive for each of the three species.\" width=\"672\">\n```\n\n## Learn more\n\nQuarto chunk options:\n- [Jupyter code chunk options for figures](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html#figures)\n- [Knitr code chunk options for figures](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html#figures)\n- [Observable code chunk options for figures](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-ojs.html#figures)\n\nGuidance for writing alt text:\n\n- [Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)\n- [Charts & accessibility](Charts & Accessibility)\n",
