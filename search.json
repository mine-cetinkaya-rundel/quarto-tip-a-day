The daily tips / tweets are in no particular order. This website collects each tip as a daily blog post entry, with each blog post linking to “learn more” resources. And, you guessed it, it’s made with Quarto!\nThe target audience for this project is folks who are already somewhat familiar with Quarto. If you’re brand new to Quarto, I recommend getting started here instead."

    "text": "If you, like me, spend most of your time writing teaching materials or documentation, I’m sure you’ll find the chunk option echo: fenced just as useful as I do! When you set this option for a code chunk, the chunk is displayed with the fences around it – without a screenshot or using a special verbatim engine.\nTo get code chunks printed out as\n\n```{r}\n#| label: simple-arithmetic\n#| results: hide\n\n1 + 1\n```\n\nadd the echo: fenced option to your chunk:\n```{r}\n#| echo: fenced\n#| label: simple-arithmetic\n#| results: hide\n\n1 + 1\n```\nNote that in the output all chunk options other than echo: fenced are shown, so this is a great tool for teaching chunk options as well."

    "text": "Showing code and output side-by-side or delayed reveal of the output are commonly used techniques for teaching programming when the mode of delivery is slides. The output-location chunk option makes it easy to achieve these.\nPossible values for the output-location option are as follows:\n\nfragment: Display output as a fragment, i.e., delay showing it until it is explicitly stepped through by advancing the slides.\nslide: Display output on the subsequent slide.\ncolumn: Display output in a column adjacent to the code. This splits the slide into two columns, each of which span 50% of the width of the slide\ncolumn-fragment: Display output in a column adjacent to the code and delay showing it until its explicitly stepped through by advancing the slides.\n\nYou can see these in action in the slide deck below.\n\nNote that for the column options I also adjusted fig-height and fig-width since the default size and aspect ration doesn’t work well for figures spanning only half the width of the slide."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For Quarto projects with many documents that include code, you probably won’t want to re-execute all of that code each time you render the project. The freeze execution option is helpful for managing that.\nFor example, you might have a Quarto blog and when you render the website you wouldn’t want code from old blog posts to be re-rendered automatically, you would likely prefer to leave them as is as of the date they were published. Or you might be using Quarto for a course website and have slides, homework assignments, etc. in that website that you add as the semester progresses. You wouldn’t want to re-render all of those old documents each time you add new items to your website.\nManaging execution for these purposes is straightforward with Quarto using the freeze option in your _quarto.yml file for your project, e.g.\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\nYou can set this option to true or auto. By default, it’s false.\n\nfreeze: true - Never re-render during project render. If you need the page/document to be re-rendered, you need to render that document individually.\n\nThis is the option I use for blogs as I want to make sure to avoid re-rendering old posts unless I explicitly do so.\n\nfreeze: auto - Re-render only when source changes.\n\nThis is the option I use for my course websites – when I catch a mistake in earlier slide decks, and update the source code, I want those documents re-render next time I render my project, I don’t want to rely on remembering to re-render them myself.\n\n\nNote that freeze controls whether execution occurs during global project renders. If you do render a single document or a sub-directory in a Quarto project, then the code is always executed."

Super useful for teaching Quarto!\nRead more: https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/01-side-by-side-tables/\n[insert-image]\nalt-text: Two R chunks are displayed. The top R chunk is the output, and shows the chunk options label: simple-arithmetic, results: hide. The R code in the chunk is 1 + 1. Also visible are the fences of the R chunk. The bottom R chunk is the input, which shows the same content as the top chunk, plus an additional chunk option: echo: fenced. The text reads “To get code chunks printed out as [the top chunk], add the echo: fenced option to your chunk”. Code and text can also be found in the linked blog post.\n\n#4 -\n#quartotip 3: Use the freeze: true or freeze: auto execution option for finer control over when documents in Quarto projects are re-rendered.\nRead more: https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/03-freeze/\n[insert-image]\nalt-text: YAML file with two execute options.
