The daily tips / tweets are in no particular order. This website collects each tip as a daily blog post entry, with each blog post linking to “learn more” resources. And, you guessed it, it’s made with Quarto!\nThe target audience for this project is folks who are already somewhat familiar with Quarto. If you’re brand new to Quarto, I recommend getting started here instead."

    "text": "If you, like me, spend most of your time writing teaching materials or documentation, I’m sure you’ll find the chunk option echo: fenced just as useful as I do! When you set this option for a code chunk, the chunk is displayed with the fences around it – without a screenshot or using a special verbatim engine.\nTo get code chunks printed out as\n\n```{r}\n#| label: simple-arithmetic\n#| results: hide\n\n1 + 1\n```\n\nadd the echo: fenced option to your chunk:\n```{r}\n#| echo: fenced\n#| label: simple-arithmetic\n#| results: hide\n\n1 + 1\n```\nNote that in the output all chunk options other than echo: fenced are shown, so this is a great tool for teaching chunk options as well."
