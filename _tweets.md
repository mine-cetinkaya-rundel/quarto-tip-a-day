Today we begin a new series: "A Quarto tip a day keeps the docs away" -- a playful attempt to share Quarto tips daily for the next month.
Follow along:

And, of course, don't keep the docs away, they're incredibly helpful and thorough!

#quartotip 2: Use the echo: fenced chunk option to display the fences around your code chunks in your output.
Super useful for teaching Quarto!

alt-text: Two R chunks are displayed.
The top R chunk is the output, and shows the chunk options label: simple-arithmetic, results: hide.
The R code in the chunk is 1 + 1.
Also visible are the fences of the R chunk.
The bottom R chunk is the input, which shows the same content as the top chunk, plus an additional chunk option: echo: fenced.
The text reads "To get code chunks printed out as \[the top chunk\], add the echo: fenced option to your chunk".
Code and text can also be found in the linked blog post.

On the left is the code, which has the chunk options output-location: column as well as fig-width: 6 and fig-height: 4.
The code uses ggplot2 to create a scatterplot of penguin bill depth vs. length, colored by species.
On the right is output showing this plot.
