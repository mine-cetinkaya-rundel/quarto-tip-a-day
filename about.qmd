Inspired by the saying "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", this project titled "A Quarto tip a day keeps the docs away" is a playful attempt to share Quarto tips for a month leading up to my rstudio::conf(2022) keynote on Quarto. Despite the title, the goal is not really to keep the documentation away, in fact, [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) is pretty awesome!

As part of this project, I will tweet a Quarto tip each day in starting June 28, 2022 for thirty days from my personal account [@minebocek](https://twitter.com/minebocek) with the hashtag `#quartotip`. The daily tips / tweets are in no particular order. This website will collect each tip as a daily blog post entry. And, you guessed it, it's made with Quarto!

The target audience for this project is folks who are already somewhat familiar with Quarto. If you're brand new to Quarto, I recommend getting started [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) instead.
